# 💊 Medicine Expiry Analysis 

## 📌 Project Overview
Hospitals often face financial losses due to expired medicines while some critical medicines still go out of stock.  
This project solves that problem using data analytics and visualization.

The **Medicine Expiry Analysis Dashboard** helps management identify expiry risks early, reduce losses, and improve inventory decisions.
